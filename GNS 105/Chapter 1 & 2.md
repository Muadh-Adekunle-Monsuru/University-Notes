According to Plato, philosophy developed out of wonder and curiosity. 

Philosophy is inescapable because as humans we always consciously or unconsciously attempt to make sense or meaning out of our environment.

Philosophy determines fundamentally the quality and essence of our lives. This is because most of our actions and judgement in life are determined or influenced by our ideas and beliefs about the world and our place in that world

**The Main Reasons Philosophy is Inescapable:**
- All humans beings are created with the need to understand and make sense of the world in which they find themselves
- Philosophy determines fundamentally the quality and essence of our lives.

**We are philosophers who do not philosophize because:**
1. We do not have a clear picture of those ideas and beliefs we claim to be ours
2. We do not take time to examine these ideas and beliefs to understand their strengths and weaknesses 

Philosophers come to the discipline from different fields, backgrounds and experiences, and this fact informs the interests and concerns they will ultimately reflect upon. 

**Definition of philosophy:**
Philosophy is essentially a reflective or meditative activity on various areas of human experience. 

A philosophical problem is general because *it covers a large territory and as many contexts as possible.* 

Philosophical problems are fundamental problems involving fundamental ideas. 

A *fundamental idea* or belief is one one which the truth of so many other specific ideas and beliefs rest. An idea is fundamental if that idea is the central foundation that gives meaning and coherence to all the other beliefs you may hold in life. 

Philosophical problems are not resolvable by empirical methods (through science or observation). A question is empirical if it can be answered by experience through observation or experimentation. 

**Characteristics of philosophical problems:**
- they involve general ideas which go beyond specific territories and contexts
- they involve fundamental ideas on which our specific beliefs rest
- they are not resolvable by empirical means. 

**What give rise to philosophical problems:**
they are usually problems about meaning in the sense that they are generated when you discover some incompatibility and contradictions in the meaning and the truth of some of the beliefs and ideas you hold.

# Chapter 3: Philosophy and Worldviews

**Define a worldview:**
The framework of ideas and beliefs through which an individual interprets the world and interacts with it. 

**Why must one formulate a worldview:**
1. A worldview gives one an insight into who one is as a person
2. Human beings also need to understand the physical world they are interacting with. Without an adequate and practical knowledge of our environment, it seems impossible that we will be able to act in any reasonable way. 
3. Psychological satisfaction a person derives from an understanding of their place in the universe

Philosophy as critical thinking, on its own, helps in sharpening the picture of the universe and of our own existence by providing our own justification for the ideas we hold. 

H. S. Staniland defines philosophy as the *"criticism of the ideas we live by".* 
It requires that one reveal the assumptions that lie behind some of one's beliefs to see whether these assumptions can survive deep reflections on them. 

**What are the elements to test a worldview with:**
- Factual adequacy
- Logical coherence
- Explanatory capacity
- Conceptual Analysis
- Reconstruction of ideas

**Factual Adequacy:**
Whether a worldview agrees or disagrees with relevant known facts and experience about what the belief is all about. 

**Logical Coherence:**
Whether the set of beliefs that makes up a worldview are in support or are contradictory. 

**Explanatory Capacity:**
Ability for a worldview to show how the entities of the universe are related or how they interact. 

**Conceptual analysis:** 
involves one's ability to give a precise and definite meaning to words one use in speaking about their beliefs. Involves ability to establish a logical relationships between a particular word and other words. 

**Reconstructions of ideas:**
involves generating better visions and pictures that will serve as further guide to life. One rebuild the structure of our worldview by adopting some of other beliefs and ideas that would fit the structure of the previous worldview.

# Chapter 4: Branches of Philosophy


We should divide philosophical questions into categories for the purpose of enabling us to separate the questions so that we can have and intelligible and less confusing perspective. 

**The three fundamental questions:**
- What is ultimately real?
- How do we know this reality and justify it?
- Having know this reality, how do we live a meaningful life?

**The core branches of philosophy:**
- Metaphysics
- Epistemology
- Ethics
- Logic

### Metaphysics

**Define Metaphysics:**
The philosophy of being and existence; Metaphysics examines the real nature of things as opposed to their apparent constitution. Or simply the theory of reality, or what is real. 

Metaphysics is the most comprehensive of all enquiries that human beings are involved in, this is because the most fundamental question is What is?

Metaphysical problems arise when we are not able to perceive immediately how the things around hand together. 

Examples of metaphysical questions:
- do we have a mind
- what is the soul
- what kind of creature am i

### Epistemology

**Define Epistemology:**
Epistemology is concerned with the nature, origin, scope, possibility, and limit of human knowledge. 

Epistemology is often called the ***Theory of knowledge***

The branch comes after metaphysics, this is because if we eventually agree on what we count to be real and unreal, the next obvious question we must ask is: *How do we get to know what is real and unreal.*

**Three fundamental questions of epistemology:**
- What is knowledge (What does it mean to say "I Know")?
- How do we get knowledge?
- Can what we call "knowledge" be so sure that we cannot doubt it

It is concerned with our claims to knowledge and the methods we employ in arriving at what we claim to know. It serves as the standard of evaluating our knowledge claims so we would be better able to differentiate between true claims and false claims. 

**Knowledge is a combination of three elements:**
- Truth
- Belief
- Justification


	*For example:
	When one says, "I know that there is a book in front of me now", for us to know that it is a piece of knowledge
	1. it must actually be true that there is a book in front of you(if it is something else, then you can't claim it is a book);
	2. you must actually believe that there is a book in front of you(it is not correct to say" I know there is a book in front of me, but I don't believe it")
	3. you must also have a reason for believing that the book is there. If one is ask how they know that the book is there, one can't just reply with "I just know"*

Examples of epistemological questions:
1. what is knowledge
2. what is truth
3. does our senses tell us anything about the world

### Ethics
**Define Ethics:**
It is the study of moral standards and how they affect human conduct; it helps in clarifying moral terms and concepts

It is also know as **moral philosophy**.
Ethics is only concerned with human moral value; that is worthwhile for us human to purse by the way of our *actions* and *behaviors*.

Action stands for the process of doing something in order to achieve a goal.

##### **Three** fundamental dimensions to understand the work of ethicists:
- Normative ethics
- meta-ethics
- Moral dilemmas

**Normative ethics** is the attempt to determine the rightness and wrongness of human actions. It is an attempt to come up with a rational and defensible theory about what makes any action right or wrong. 

**Principles an ethicist could consider to make moral judgements**:
- the moral value of an action should be judged in terms of the **consequences of that action** (Thus if stealing food saves the lives of many children, it is ethically "good")
- The nature of the action itself and not the consequence. (Since stealing itself is wrong, it doesn't matter if many children starve to death, one shouldn't steal at all)

**Ethical Egoism**: Saying an action is right if it promotes ones best interest alone to the detriment of others. And if an action neglects you, then it must be wrong.

Ethicists are also interested in the question of whether or not he moral principles apply to everybody **equally** or whether it is the **situation** that determines the moral judgement of an action


**Meta-ethics:**

Moral judgement refers to the activity of judging whether or not an action, a person, something, or an institution has a moral attribute. 

When one says "Don is a good person" what does one mean by "good". 


The dimension of ethics that considers the issue of where our moral terms and principles come from. 

**Three questions that comes under meta-ethics:**
- Are moral standards and principles dependent on the agreement of human beings or are they existing on their own?
- What motivates human beings to be moral? 
- What is the meaning of "good", "right", "wrong", "immoral", "bad"

	1. Are moral standards objective (God Commanded) or subjective (Depends on societal taste)
	2. Possible answer to the question raised:
		1. We are motived to be moral because we have been endowed with an inner sense of right and wrong; which tells us subconsciously the right way to achieve happiness in life.
		2. We are motivated because we are selfish beings always looking for what is in our own interests
		3. Our reason motivates us to do good things. 
	3. It is purely linguistic. So argue that these terms express one emotions and desires about something, while other argue that one is referring to certain natural qualities like pleasure. 

**Moral Dilemmas:**
A moral dilemma is a certain situation which requires making a choice between two opposing courses of action. Each of these courses of action has good reason in support of it. 
*check page 41-42 for examples*

Applied ethics is the dimension that enables one to make a right decision in such situations. It combines strategies gained in normative ethics and meta-ethics to analyses highly contested issues. 



### Logic:

**What is logic**
It is the study of propositions and their use in argumentation; It is the theory of reasoning

If epistemology is concerned with our knowledge of reality, the concern of logic is how we *successfully justify* between good reasons and bad reasons.

An **argument** is made up of *propositions* or declarative statements, which can be *true* or *false*. 

The **conclusion** stands for a particular **claim** one makes with a statement i.e "He is the most humble student"

The **premise** serves as the **reason** one has for **supporting** the claim one made. 

If the premises support the conclusion 100% then we say that it is a **deductive argument.** 

If the premises only support the conclusion to some degree less than 100% then it is an **inductive argument.** 

Errors in reasoning are called **fallacy**. A fallacy is a *bad argument* or an argument that does *not* follow the correct reasoning method. 

---
Philosophy also covers other disciplines such as Law, education, science, religion. All these disciplines and vocations are called *first order disciplines*. To be first order means they have a particular and specific range of subject matter they are dealing with. Philosophy is also in a sense a first order discipline. 

But it can also be called a second order discipline. By second order, it is the application of philosophical tools to the analysis of other first order disciplines. For example, there is philosophy of mind, all these are situations of applying philosophy to the subject matter of other disciplines.

# Chapter 5: Appearance and Reality

**Define immediate experience:**
Experience that  our senses give to us without  anything standing in between.

**Why do we need to understand the difference between appearance and reality?**
It is to help us be cautious in accepting all that is presented to us. 

Our experience/senses does not always provide us with the knowledge about the real nature of things. 

**Define reality:**
Reality refers to what it means for anything to be or to exist. The totality of all things that are real in the universe. 

The nature of color is dependent on a number of factors like light, and darkness, angle and so on. Color, in a sense, could therefore be characterized as an appearance because its reality is dependent on our thinking and perception.

# Chapter 6: Skepticism and Knowledge

The problem of scepticism and knowledge arises from the attempt to answer one fundamental question: Do we have any knowledge in this world that is so certain that nobody can doubt it? 

**Three fundamental categories of knowledge:**
- Knowledge of acquaintance (or, knowledge of: things, places, and persons)
- Knowledge of skill or a special ability or performance (Knowledge of how)
- Knowledge of facts (knowledge of that) or Propositional knowledge

Propositional knowledge implies the possession of a piece of information that is not open to falsehood. In other words, any claim to know that so and so must be so certain, definite and reliable that it cannot be doubted. 

There is a consensus in epistemology that knowledge derives from our beliefs. 


### Scepticism

Scepticism is the position that we can never have enough certainty in our claim to knowledge. 

Scepticism questions the reasons, evidence and justification that we have for believing what we claim to believe. The fundamental challenge of the sceptic is not about the standards we employ to prove the truth of our claims. Rather, the sceptic poses is whether or not those standards are appropriate in supporting our claims. 

**Scepticism is significant in two respects;**
- it helps us not to accept claims and dogmatic statements that are not supported with evidence
- It motivates us to reflect on our own claims so as to only make valid claims

**Two forms of scepticism** 
- Universal scepticism
- Limited Scepticism

**Universal scepticism** is the claim that we can never know anything for certain. It argues that humans cannot have any kind of knowledge of anything because none of our beliefs are every justified, because there would always be reasons to doubt the reasons we give in support of our justifications. 

```
It is a difficult position to hold because it already presupposesthat there is at least one thing that we can know. In other words, if I claim that we can't know anything for certain, then I am also claiming that I know something for certain: What I know for certain is that we can never know anything for certain. 
```


**Limited scepticism,** hold the position that some of our knowledge claims- especially in science, religion and ethics;- are not really justified, and hence cannot be held with certainty. 


**Differentiate between universal scepticism and limited scepticism?**
The difference is concerning the scope of each of them. Universal skepticism holds that we cannot know anything for sure. While limited scepticism holds that we can know some things for certain.
