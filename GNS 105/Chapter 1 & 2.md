According to Plato, philosophy developed out of wonder and curiosity. 

Philosophy is inescapable because as humans we always consciously or unconsciously attempt to make sense or meaning out of our environment.

Philosophy determines fundamentally the quality and essence of our lives. This is because most of our actions and judgement in life are determined or influenced by our ideas and beliefs about the world and our place in that world

**The Main Reasons Philosophy is Inescapable:**
- All humans beings are created with the need to understand and make sense of the world in which they find themselves
- Philosophy determines fundamentally the quality and essence of our lives.

**We are philosophers who do not philosophize because:**
1. We do not have a clear picture of those ideas and beliefs we claim to be ours
2. We do not take time to examine these ideas and beliefs to understand their strengths and weaknesses 

Philosophers come to the discipline from different fields, backgrounds and experiences, and this fact informs the interests and concerns they will ultimately reflect upon. 

**Definition of philosophy:**
Philosophy is essentially a reflective or meditative activity on various areas of human experience. 

A philosophical problem is general because *it covers a large territory and as many contexts as possible.* 

Philosophical problems are fundamental problems involving fundamental ideas. 

A *fundamental idea* or belief is one one which the truth of so many other specific ideas and beliefs rest. An idea is fundamental if that idea is the central foundation that gives meaning and coherence to all the other beliefs you may hold in life. 

Philosophical problems are not resolvable by empirical methods (through science or observation). A question is empirical if it can be answered by experience through observation or experimentation. 

**Characteristics of philosophical problems:**
- they involve general ideas which go beyond specific territories and contexts
- they involve fundamental ideas on which our specific beliefs rest
- they are not resolvable by empirical means. 

**What give rise to philosophical problems:**
they are usually problems about meaning in the sense that they are generated when you discover some incompatibility and contradictions in the meaning and the truth of some of the beliefs and ideas you hold.

# Chapter 3: Philosophy and Worldviews

**Define a worldview:**
The framework of ideas and beliefs through which an individual interprets the world and interacts with it. 

**Why must one formulate a worldview:**
1. A worldview gives one an insight into who one is as a person
2. Human beings also need to understand the physical world they are interacting with. Without an adequate and practical knowledge of our environment, it seems impossible that we will be able to act in any reasonable way. 
3. Psychological satisfaction a person derives from an understanding of their place in the universe

Philosophy as critical thinking, on its own, helps in sharpening the picture of the universe and of our own existence by providing our own justification for the ideas we hold. 

H. S. Staniland defines philosophy as the *"criticism of the ideas we live by".* 
It requires that one reveal the assumptions that lie behind some of one's beliefs to see whether these assumptions can survive deep reflections on them. 

**What are the elements to test a worldview with:**
- Factual adequacy
- Logical coherence
- Explanatory capacity
- Conceptual Analysis
- Reconstruction of ideas

**Factual Adequacy:**
Whether a worldview agrees or disagrees with relevant known facts and experience about what the belief is all about. 

**Logical Coherence:**
Whether the set of beliefs that makes up a worldview are in support or are contradictory. 

**Explanatory Capacity:**
Ability for a worldview to show how the entities of the universe are related or how they interact. 

**Conceptual analysis:** 
involves one's ability to give a precise and definite meaning to words one use in speaking about their beliefs. Involves ability to establish a logical relationships between a particular word and other words. 

**Reconstructions of ideas:**
involves generating better visions and pictures that will serve as further guide to life. One rebuild the structure of our worldview by adopting some of other beliefs and ideas that would fit the structure of the previous worldview.
