The System Unit

Motherboard contains 

Different cpus makes use of different word sizes. 
THe higher the word size the faster the cpu can execute instruction. 

system clock, it sends out a pulse of electricity at regular interval to allow the components of the system to work. 

First personal computers had 8mHz clock speed

### Memory chips,
- RAM, main memory, holds volatile data, 1000x faster than your secondary storage. 

- Cache: Temporarily stores data and instructions needed by the cpu 
level 1: fastest
level 2: fast 
Level 3: slowest but largest memory

- ROM: Used to store permanent system software. 
- CMOS: Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor: powered by batteries. CMOS  contains flexible information, stores the hard drive and the date and time
- Flash: chips which do not require electricity, they are non volatile. Used in computer devices.


### Expansion Slots

Serial ports; 1 bits at a time
Parrallel ports: 8 bits, bytes
USB; much faster than both


Secondary storage: devices that hold data and information
