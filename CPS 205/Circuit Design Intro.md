**Objective:**
- Combining the gates together
- Derive the boolean function for the circuit
- Derive the output of the circuit

Circuits is also known as a **Block Diagram**.


#### Note that when you are to determine the functions and outputs of a circuit diagram:
1. Identify the types of logic gates is/are used
2. Identify the sets of inputs 
3. Associate an **AND** Gate with *multiplication*
4. Associate an **OR** gate with *addition*


#### POS- Product of Sum
$$(A+B)(Abar+B)(Bbar+C)$$
each expression in brackets are sum terms.
When one has sum terms which is combined with AND Gate


#### Literals:
Every variable that one sees including complements in an expression is called a literal.

#### **SOP - Sum of Product**:
The expression below shows one using an OR Gate to sum the three expressions
The individual expressions are called *product terms.* 

**When one has product terms which is combined with OR Gate**

$$AB + ĀB + ḂC$$
