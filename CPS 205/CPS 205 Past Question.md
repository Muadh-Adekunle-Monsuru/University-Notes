1. Explain the following terms
	**What is the gray code:** only one variable changes between adjacent squares when setting up the karaugh map. 

	**What are combinational circuits:** is the digital logic circuit in which the output depends on the combination of inputs at that point in time, with disregard to the past state of the inputs. 

	**Sequential Circuits:** Consists of both logic gates and memory elements such as flip-flops. 

	**what are karnaugh maps** It is a method of simplifying complex circuits into smaller ones to aid speed and performance

	Integrated circuits

	Digital Systems

1.  There are five major types of ICs 
 i. **DRAM (Dynamic random Access Memory):** It is a volatile memory, it requires an external memory refresh circuits which periodically rewrites the data stored. 
 ii. **MPUs (Microprocessor Units)**: Type of ICs that acts as the cpu for a computer, programmed with instructions that cannot be easily deleted, even when power is lost. 
 iii. **Application Specific Ics (ASIC):** Type of ICs that are customized for a particular use. Such as one in a voice recorder. 
 iv. **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):** 
 v. **Programmable memory chips (EPROMs):** 
3. Why must a system designer strive to build less complex circuits?
4. Write short notes on the following
	1. Perpheral devices
	2. printers
	3. primary memory
	4. magnetic devices
	5. character recognition device
5. Among the selling points of microcomputer are:
	1. the size of the RAM
	2. The speed of the processor
	3. The size of the hard disk
	Write an essay of not more that 70 words to justify each of the selling points
6. Factors to consider when one wants to buy a printer
7. Differentiate between the following
	1. Primary and secondary storage
	2. Hard disks and magnetic tapes
	3. DRAM and MPUs
	4. Combinational circuits and Sequential Circuits
	5. Laser and Inkjet Printers
