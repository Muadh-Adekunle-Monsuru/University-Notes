1. Explain the following terms
	**What is the gray code:** The Gray code is a type of binary code where each successive value has only one bit changed.
	In context of K-maps only one variable changes between adjacent squares. 

	**What are combinational circuits:** is the digital logic circuit in which the output depends on the combination of inputs at that point in time, with disregard to the past state of the inputs. 

	**Sequential Circuits:** Consists of both logic gates and memory elements such as flip-flops. The output of a sequential circuit not only depends on the current input, but also on the stored state, which changes over time in response to inputs.

	**what are karnaugh maps** It is a method of simplifying complex circuits into smaller ones to aid speed and performance

	Integrated circuits

	**Digital Systems:** Digital systems are electronic systems that process information using binary digits (bits) to represent and manipulate data. They use logical operations to perform various tasks, such as data storage, communication, control, and processing.

2.  There are five major types of ICs 
 i. **DRAM (Dynamic random Access Memory):** It is a volatile memory, it requires an external memory refresh circuits which periodically rewrites the data stored. 
 ii. **MPUs (Microprocessor Units)**: Type of ICs that acts as the cpu for a computer, programmed with instructions that cannot be easily deleted, even when power is lost. 
 iii. **Application Specific Ics (ASIC):** Type of ICs that are customized for a particular use. Such as one in a voice recorder. 
 iv. **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):** 
 v. **Programmable memory chips (EPROMs):** 
3. Why must a system designer strive to build less complex circuits?
	- **Cost**: simple circuits tend to be less expensive to design, fabricate and test
	- **Reliability**: Complex circuits are more prone to failure as there are more points of failure
	- **Ease of maintenance**: simple circuits are easier to maintain and troubleshoot
	- **Ease of design:** Simple circuits are easier to design and verify. 
	- **Power consumption:** simple circuits tend to consume less power, which is important in battery powered devices
4. Write short notes on the following
	1. Peripheral devices
	2. printers
	3. primary memory
	4. magnetic devices
	5. character recognition device
5. Among the selling points of microcomputer are:
	1. the size of the RAM
	2. The speed of the processor
	3. The size of the hard disk
	 Write an essay of not more that 70 words to justify each of the selling points
    1. The size of the RAM (Random Access Memory) is a selling point of microcomputers because it directly affects the performance and efficiency of the system. A larger RAM size allows the computer to store more data and run more applications at the same time, without slowing down.
    
	2.  The speed of the processor is a critical selling point, as it determines how quickly the computer can perform tasks. A faster processor can handle more complex operations, run more demanding software, and deliver better performance overall.
    
	3.  The size of the hard disk is another important selling point, as it determines the amount of data that can be stored on the computer. A larger hard disk allows for more storage of files, music, videos, and other types of digital content, reducing the need to constantly transfer or delete files.
6. Factors to consider when one wants to buy a printer
	1.  **Purpose**: What will the printer be used for (e.g. text documents, color photos, graphics, etc.)? This will help determine the type of printer that is needed (e.g. inkjet, laser, or photo printer).
    
	2.  **Print quality:** What level of print quality is required (e.g. resolution, color accuracy, etc.)?
    
	3.  **Connectivity**: What type of connectivity is needed (e.g. USB, Ethernet, Wi-
7. Differentiate between the following
	1. Primary and secondary storage
	2. Hard disks and magnetic tapes
		1. Hard disks are commonly used in desktop and laptop computers, while magnetic tapes are often used for backup and archival storage, where large amounts of data need to be stored for long periods of time. Hard disks are much faster than magnetic tapes for both reading and writing data.
	3. DRAM and MPUs
	4. Combinational circuits and Sequential Circuits
	5. Laser and Inkjet Printers

	6. List applications of DAC
	7. Mention types of RAM
	8. What is USB
	9. Describe DAC and ADC
	10. Describe the applications of combinational logic circuits
	11. Explain the design procedures for combinational logic circutis

	13. What is a multiplexer
	14. Design 4 by 1 multiplexer
	15. Convert 0101 to gray code
	16. Construct decade 4-bit synchronous counter
	17. Convert 9F2 to base 2
	18. Design 8 by 3 encoder
	19. Convert 1011.101 to decimal
	20. convert 423 to hexadecimal
