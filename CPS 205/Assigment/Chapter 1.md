Reasons why philosophy is inevitable

According to Plato, philosophy developed out of wonder and curiosity. 

Philosophy is inescapable because as humans we always consciously or unconsciously attempt to make sense or meaning out of our environment.
Why we are created at all and where we are heading

Philosophy determines fundamentally the quality and essence of our lives. This is because most of our actions and judgement in life are determined or influenced by our ideas and beliefs about the world and our place in that world

**The Main Reasons Philosophy is Inescapable:**
- All humans beings are created with the need to understand and make sense of the world in which they find themselves
- Philosophy determines fundamentally the quality and essence of our lives.

This tells us that though we may all be philosophers, who are concerned about their existence and the world we live in, we do not really philosophise. In other words, we take most of these ideas at face value
