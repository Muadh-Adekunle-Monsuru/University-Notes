## Advantages of VLSI Technology:

-   Size of circuits is reduces.
-   VLSI occupies a relatively low area.
-   VLSI uses much lower power.
-   The use of VLSI in circuits has a high level of reliability. Unlike transistors.
-   Operation speeds is drastically faster than previous generation.
-   The deviceâ€™s overall cost is now reduced.
