**Define active components in a circuit:**
These components are **parts of a circuit that rely on an external power source to control or modify electrical signals**


 **Examples of an active component of a circuit**
- Transistors
- amplifiers

**Define passive components in a circuit:**
These circuit components don’t need an external power source to function.  they only require the current traveling through the connected circuit.

**Examples of passive component of a circuit**
- Capacitors
- Diodes

**Define Solid State Components:**
electronic device in which electricity flows through solid semiconductor crystals rather than through vacuum tubes.

**What is an IC:**
It is a component in which all the passive and active components are infused into a single unit.


SSI- Small Scale Integration - 1- 100 transistors
MSI - Medium Scale Integration - 100- 1000 transistors
LSI - Large Scale Integration - 1000 - 10000 transistors
VLSI - Very-large scale - 10,000 - 1,000,000 transistors

Disadvantages of vacuum tubes:
- Vacuum Tubes
- Burn out
- Slow
- Big
