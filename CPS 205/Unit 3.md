## Logic Gates

### General Areas of logic:
- Thinking in terms of 0s &1s binary
- How the wires carries the sequences of zeros and ones

#### Thinking in terms of 0s and 1s:
Circuits are made up of logic gates which are connected by wires that carry the signals around.
Which are called  **logic signals**. Their are a number of different ways of representing logic signals, such as voltage, analogue signals. 

A voltage can take on two values assuming we have an electronic device that generates binary signals the logic signal a takes on the value zero meaning off, or one meaning its true or on. 

**What are logic gates:**
Gates are building blocks of digital computer circuits. A gates is an electronic device that produces results based on two or more input values. Gates consists of one to six transistors. 
These gates are not sold individually they are sold in chips, a group of gates are ICs.
==How are the gates represented using truth table or circuit diagram or a symbolic method==
*Give truth table and circuit diagram of gates when asked in the exam.* 

- **The AND Gates:**
Define an AND Gate:
