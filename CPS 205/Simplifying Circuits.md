#### Simplification Using Boolean Algebra:
Design a logic circuit h

#### Karnaugh Maps
It is a grid of squares with each square representing one minterms
The minterms are ordered according to a Gray code. 
Gray code is about only one variable changing. 

Squares on the edges are considered adjacent to squares on the opposite end.
