**What is the gray code:** 
only one variable changes between adjacent squares when setting up the karaugh map. 

**What are combinational circuits:**
is the digital logic circuit in which the output depends on the combination of inputs at that point in time, with disregard to the past state of the inputs. 

**Sequential Circuits:**
Consists of both logic gates and memory elements such as flip-flops. 

**what are karnaugh maps**
It is a method of simplifying complex circuits into smaller ones to aid speed and performance


**â€¢ There are five major types of Ics** 
 i. DRAM (Dynamic random Access Memory): It is a volatile memory, it requires an external memory refresh circuits which periodically rewrites the data stored. 
 ii. MPUs (Microprocessor Units): Type of ICs that acts as the cpu for a computer, programmed with instructions that cannot be easily deleted, even when power is lost. 
 iii. Application Specific Ics (ASIC): Type of ICs that are customized for a particular use. Such as one in a voice recorder. 
 iv. Digital Signal Processor (DSP): 
 v. Programmable memory chips (EPROMs):
