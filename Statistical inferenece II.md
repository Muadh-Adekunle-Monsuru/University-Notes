Statistical inference could be defined as the act of drawing inferences about a population or characteristics from information contained in a sample. In this process, if a population value is known, there will be no need to make inferences about them.

## Sampling Theory
Sampling theory is a study of relationship of a population and samples drawn from the population. It is of great value in many connections. It is useful in estimation of know population quantities. Useful in estimation of unknown population  quantities such as population mean, variance e.t.c. Often called population parameter or briefly parameters from a knowledge of corresponding sample qualities such as sample mean, variance, e.t.c. Often called sample statistics or briefly statistics. 
In general, a study of inferences made concerning a population by use of sample drawn from it together with indications of the accuracy of such inferences using probability theory is called statistical inference. 

## Sampling Distribution

If we take a sample from a give size of a population and repeat the sampling as many times as possible, calculate the mean of each sample and summarize into a frequency distribution, the resulting distribution is called  sampling Dist of the sample mean. 

Suppose we have a population
S = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
A possible interpretation of the population can be that it is  a list of all possible outcomes of throwing a die once. The probability

distribution of this population can be as follows.
