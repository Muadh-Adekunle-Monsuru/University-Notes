1. (i) Logic gates:A gates is an electronic device that produces results based on one or more input values. They consist of one to six transistors.
(ii) Integrated circuits:  is a series of transistors placed on a small, flat piece that is usually made of silicon. It is a type of circuit that eliminates the need for several components through the use of silicon board and soldering for electrical conduction.

(iii) It is a method of simplifying complex circuits into smaller ones to aid speed and performance

2. Less complex circuits will require less gates which would reduce the cost of the circuit. It also increases the reliability of the circuit as their are fewer com ponents. The size of the ic would also be reduced
