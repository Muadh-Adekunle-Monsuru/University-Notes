Write short note on the following:
1. **Simple Random Sampling:** A simple random sample of size n element is a sample drawn in such a way that every combination of n element has an equal chance of being the sample selected. The probability is 1/n
2. **Stratified Sampling:** In stratified random sampling the population is classified into actually exclusive sub-groups or strata and probability samples are drawn independently from each of these strata. A sample from each strata maybe obtained by simple random sampling.
3. **Cluster Sampling**: this is a technique in which the population is subdivided into groups or clusters, then a probability sample of this clusters is drawn and studied. The samples in a clusters do not necessarily have homogeneity with each other. 
4. **Systematic Sampling:** you select every kth elements of the population until you have all the sample in the population k can be any number. Thus if you wish to select a sample of 100 persons from total population of 10,000, you would take every hundredth individual (K=N/n = 10,000/100 = 100).


**What is the null and alternative hypotheses:**
Null hypotheses: A claim that there is no effect in the population
Alternative hypotheses: A claim that there is an effect in the population

**What is a simple hypotheses:**
A hypothesis that, when true, completely specifies the population distribution is called a _simple_ hypothesis; one that does not is called a _composite_ hypothesis.

**What are type 1 errors:**
The first of these, called a _type I error,_ is said to result if the test incorrectly calls for rejecting Ho when it is indeed correct. The second, called a _type II error,_ results if the test calls for accepting $H_0$ when it is false.

A type I error (false-positive) occurs if an investigator rejects a null hypothesis that is actually true in the population; a type II error (false-negative) occurs if the investigator fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false in the population.

**Difference between correlation and regression:**
Correlation quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between a pair of variables, whereas regression expresses the relationship in the form of an equation.

**One and Two tailed test**

In a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis specifies the direction of the effect. For example, if we are testing the effect of a new drug on blood pressure, the alternative hypothesis might be that the drug will lower blood pressure, but not that it will increase blood pressure. This would be a one-tailed test because we are only interested in the direction of the effect that is specified in the alternative hypothesis.

In a two-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect. Instead, it only states that the effect is different from the null hypothesis. For example, in the drug example above, the alternative hypothesis might be that the drug will have any effect on blood pressure (either increase or decrease). This would be a two-tailed test because the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect.

In general, one-tailed tests are more powerful than two-tailed tests, but they are also more specific. If you have a strong prediction about the direction of the effect, a one-tailed test might be appropriate. If you are simply testing for the presence of an effect without any specific prediction about the direction, a two-tailed test might be more appropriate.
