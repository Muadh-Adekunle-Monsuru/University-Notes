**Four rules of binary addition:**

### Representing Signed Numbers:

#### Sign/Magnitude Notation:
The first (leftmost) bit would be used to represent the sign of the number. 1 being negative and 0 being positive, while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the number. 

For Example:

#### Two's complement representation:
all binary patterns from 000 . . . 0 to 111 . . . 1 in increasing order. Here is what that circle might look like using 3-digit numbers:

#### Fractional Numbers

To represent fractional numbers in binary it must first be converted to scientific notation

where M is the mantissa, B is the exponent base (usually 2), and E is the exponent
