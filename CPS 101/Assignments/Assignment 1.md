Write a brief chronologycal history of computer:

  

If we were to use a loose definition of the what we call a 'computer' - i.e. Devices used to aid computation - the history of computer would date as far back thousand of years. The most well known of them being the Abacus. After the invention of the Abacus many other forms of counting boards and tables have been invented. In a medieval Europe, checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, a method of calculating sums of money.

  

Now, using the conventional definition of  'computer' most people are familiar with the history of computer can be said to have really started in the early 20th century. The earliest forms of digital computer were electromechanincal in design, meaning they were made of relays which were driven by electric switches. In 1938 the US Navy had electromecahnical systems which were fitted on some of their submarine fleet to solve the trigonometry problem of shooting a Torpedo. It was name the Torpedo Data Computer.

  

Another early electromechanical computer is the Z2, which was created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939. 2 years after the Z2, Zuse built the Z3 which is considered the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer. Almost a decade later, Konrad Zuse completed his Z4 which was the world's first commercial computer.

  

While Zuse was working on his Z computers, extensive developments have being taking place with fully electronic digital computers. By 1942, the first "automatic electronic digital computer" was tested at Iowa State University.

  

In 1944, the Colussus was built for the British military to crack the German's Enigma Machine. The Colussus is considered the world first fully programmable electronical computer.

  

The Manchester Baby was the world's first stored-program computer. Built at the University of Manchester, the computer ran its first program on 21 June 1948.

  

Right after the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project began at the university to develop it into a practically useful computer, which gave birth to the Mark 1, world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.

  

The first completely transistorized computer is the Harwell CADET of 1955, built by the electronics division at Harwell.

  

The metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET), was invented at Bell Labs in 1959.[[CPS 205/Assignment 1]] It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. The MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits. The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution, and became the driving force behind the computer revolution.

  

The 60s upwards saw an explosion in computer manufacting and adoption. By the early 21th century computers had become an household item.
