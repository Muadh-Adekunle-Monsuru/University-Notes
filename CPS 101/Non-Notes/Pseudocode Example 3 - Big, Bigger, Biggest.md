The third algorithm we will develop is similar to the sequential search in Figure 2.13 in that it also searches a list of values. However, this time the algorithm will search not for a particular value supplied by the user but for the numerically largest value in a list of numbers.

Formally, the problem we will be solving in this section is defined as follows: 

		Given a value n â‰¥ 1 and a list containing exactly n unique numbers called A1, A2, . . . , An, find and print out both the largest value in the list and the position in the list where that largest value occurred.
