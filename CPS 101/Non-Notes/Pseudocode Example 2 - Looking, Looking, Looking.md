Finding a solution to a given problem is called **algorithm discovery**, and it is the most challenging and creative part of the problem-solving process.

The next problem we will solve was also mentioned in Chapter 1—locating a particular person’s name in a telephone book

Assume that we have a list of 10,000 names that we define as N1, N2, N3, . . . , N10,000, along with the 10,000 telephone numbers of those individuals, denoted as T1, T2, T3, . . . , T10,000. To simplify the problem, we initially assume that all names in the book are unique and that the names need not be in alphabetical order. 

Let’s create an algorithm that allows us to input the name of a specific person, which we will denote as NAME. The algorithm will check to see if NAME matches any of the 10,000 names contained in our telephone book. If NAME matches the value Nj , where j is a value between 1 and 10,000, then the output of our algorithm will be the telephone number of that person: the value Tj . If NAME is not contained in our telephone book, then the output of our algorithm will be the message “I am sorry but this name is not in the directory.”

there is no method more efficient than starting at the beginning and looking at each name in the list, one at a time, until we either find the one we are looking for or come to the end of the list. This rather simple and straightforward technique is called **sequential search**, and it is the standard algorithm for searching an unordered list of values

The algorithm in Figure 2.12 shows how we might write a loop to implement the sequential search technique. It uses a variable called i as an **index**, or **pointer**, into the list of all names. That is, Ni refers to the ith name in the list. The algorithm then repeatedly executes a group of statements using different values of i. The variable i can be thought of as a “moving finger” scanning the list of names and pointing to the one on which the algorithm is currently working.

The first time through the loop, the value of the index i is 1, so the algorithm checks to see whether NAME is equal to N1, the first name on the list. If it is, then the algorithm writes out the result and sets Found to YES, which causes the loop in steps 4 through 7 to terminate. If it is not the desired NAME, then i is incremented by 1 (in step 7) so that it now has the value 2, and the loop is executed again. The algorithm now checks (in step 4) to see whether NAME is equal to N2, the second name on the list. In this way, the algorithm uses the single conditional statement “If NAME is equal to the ith name on the list . . .” to check up to 10,000 names. It executes that one line over and over, each time with a different value of i. This is the advantage of using iteration.

This final problem can be solved by terminating the loop when the desired name is found or the end of the list is reached. The algorithm can determine exactly what happened by checking the value of Found when the loop terminates. If the value of Found is NO, then the loop terminated because the index i exceeded 10,000, and we searched the entire list without finding the desired NAME. The algorithm should then produce an appropriate message.

An iterative solution to the sequential search algorithm that incorporates this feature is shown in Figure 2.13. The sequential search algorithm shown in Figure 2.13 is a correct solution to our telephone book look up problem. It meets all the requirements listed in Section 1.3.1: It is well ordered, each of the operations is clearly defined and effectively computable, and it is certain to halt with the desired result after a finite number of operations.
