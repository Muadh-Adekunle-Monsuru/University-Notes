Building a base-10 “decimal computer” requires finding a device with 10 distinct and stable energy states that can be used to represent the 10 unique digits (0, 1, . . . , 9) of the decimal system. For example, assume there exists a device that can store electrical charges in the range 0 to +45 volts. We could use it to build a decimal computer by letting certain voltage levels correspond to specific decimal digits:

As electrical devices age they become unreliable, and they may drift, or change their energy state, over time. What if the device representing the value 8 (the one set to +40 volts) lost 6% of its voltage (not a huge amount for an old, well-used piece of equipment)? The voltage would drop from +40 volts to about +37.5 volts. The question is whether the value +37.5 represents the digit 7 (+35) or the digit 8 (+40). It is impossible to say. If that same device lost another 6% of its voltage, it would drop from +37.5 volts to about +35 volts. Our 8 has now become a 7, and the original value of 28 has unexpectedly changed to 27. Building a reliable decimal machine would be an engineering nightmare.


**Bistable Environment**: an environment in which there are only two stable states separated by a huge energy barrier. 
Examples of Bistable states:
- Full on/ full off
- fully charged/ fully discharged


Examples of bistable components:
Magnetic Core:
A core is a small, magnetizable, iron oxide-coated doughnut.  The two states used to represent the binary values 0 and 1 are based on the direction of t
