## Classification based on size

### Supercomputer:
The fastest computers. Employed for specialized application that require immense amounts of calculations. 

### Mainframe
A large computer capable of handling and processing very large amounts of data.
Usually used by large institutions

### Mini Computer:
A computer with processing and storage capabilities smaller than those of a mainframe but larger than those of a micro computer. Possesses most of the features and capabilities of a large computer but in a smaller physical size.

### Micro Computer:
A small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its CPU.

## Hybrid Computer

A computer that combines the characteristic of a digital computer and an analog computer. It can accept digital or analog input. But the information is processed digitally.

For example a petrol pump contains a processor that converts fuel flow measurement into quantity and price
