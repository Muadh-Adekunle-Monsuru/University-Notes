**Programming**: Act of instructing a computer to carry out some desired instructions using an appropriate programming language. 

E.g. FORTRAN, C, C++, C#, JAVA, PYTHON. 

**Programming Language:** This is a set of notations used to instruct the computer to carry out our desired needs.

For every computer language there must be a compiler or interpreter to translate the instructions written in human-readable form to its equivalent machine language instructions.

Source Code ---> Interpreter --> Object Code

Syntax are the rules guiding the formation of languages.

### Process of Compilation:

- Checks for the syntactic correctness of source code
- Semantic correctness: meaning that is given to the instruction written
