**Advantages of computer method of data processing over manual methods:**
- Speed
- Accuracy
- Consistency
- Storage
- Flexibility

**Differentiate between multiprogramming and multitasking:**

Multiprogramming is a technique used in operating systems design to execute multiple tasks on a single processor. While multitasking is a general term for performing multiple tasks simultaneously on a computer system. 
l
Multitasking is a broader term that encompasses multiprogramming, as well as other forms of task management, such as time-sharing, multi-threading, and parallel processing. 
Multiprogramming is where multiple tasks are stored in memory and executed by the CPU, switching between them so that each task appears to be running simultaneously.

**Basic elements of a programming language:**
- Syntax: set of rules that define the structure of the language
- Variables
- Data types
- Operators
- Control Structures; used to control the flow of a program, such as loops and conditional statements
- Functions: reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times with different inputs

**Examples of supercomputers:**
- iBM Roadrunner
- Deep Blue

**Examples of Mainframe computers:**
- IBM zSeries of computers
- NonStop by HP

**SQL** means *Structures Query Language*

**ALGOL** means: *Algorithmic Language*

**Functions of the Control unit:**
- Interprets instructions
- Controls data flow inside the processor

**Why is operating system described as a master programme?**
- Because is serves as the central control program for a computer
- It manages the hardware and software resources of the computer. 
- It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware
- Because of its central role in controlling and coordinating the operations of a computer, it is considered the master program.
