### Verb
It is a word that denotes an action, occurrence or state of being. It is the most important part of speech.
The verb can be a finite or non-finite verb. A finite verb is a verb that is tied to the subject, e.g., He goes to school. If the subject, ‘he’ is changed to ‘they’, for instance, the verb, ‘goes’ becomes ‘go’. Therefore, it is a finite verb. On the other hand, a non-finite verb is a verb that is not tied to the subject, e.g., Beaten by snake, he died. The verb, ‘beaten’ is a non-finite verb because it is not tied to any subject
### Auxiliary Verbs:

	**Primary**: 
			are be-verbs which are: be, am, is, are, was, were, being & been.
				- *I **am** sleeping*
				- *She **was** sitting*
			When an auxiliary verb is not combined or supporting a main verb, it becomes a main verb
				*- I **am** the man*
	**Secondary**:
			Also call **modal** verbs. Verbs that express more than one meaning. *Shall, should, will, would* 

### Main Verbs:
