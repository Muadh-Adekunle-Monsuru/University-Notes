IRREPARABLE LOSS

Abdussalam Sulayman

---

This is a captivating story of redemption, adversity, regret and so much more. The writer did an amazing work in being able to pack so much emotional attachment, character development and life lessons into such a few number of pages.

Each major character in the story went through a form of character development one way or another throughout the story. From the main protagonist, Qasim, to then main antagonist Gbenga, to their parents.

As someone descends into debauchery and degeneracy, one is brought out into light and guidance.

### Chapter 1

The story opened with a gunshot, which rang out at the matriculation ceremony of BENSU, followed by six young men searching through the premise for what seems like a particular person. The scene understandably shocked all the attendees of the event, yet the Student Union decided to proceed with the ceremony after the hoodlums had been apprehended.

The school's head of Muslim Students Society then took to the stage to console the parents and inform them that such occurrences is uncommon on the campus and it only affects the cult members of the school. The Amir then advised the students to be an active member of the MSSN instead of other clubs who claim to be "Cool".

The gathering was dispersed that the evening when the parameter of the campus was confirmed to be safe.

### Chapter 2

While packing for his trip, Qasim's parents have a disagreement over the hostel their son should reside in while at the university. Mr. Adekambi wanted his son to be in the _Muslim Arcade_, which is occupied by many of the school's Muslim students, while Mrs. Adekambi wanted him to reside in _California_, a hostel that is known to be for the student elites.

Mr. Adekambi eventually relented and accepted that Qasim could stay in California, since his son schooled abroad, he might not be used to the non-luxurious _Muslim Arcade_.

Mr. Adekambi pulled his son to the side to have a personal one on one talk with him after dinner. While giving him valuable advices, Mrs. Adekambi rudely interrupted their conversation on the basis that the talk is getting too much for her son, and Qasim is pulled away to his room. His wife's behaviour has been irritating him for a long time but this particular night it was just too painful to handle.

Apparently, Mr. Adekambi met his wife at the university and ‘fell in love’ with her after during a short period. Ignoring the advice of multiple seniors and elders, he proposed to her and got married. It was after their marriage that his wife began to show her true colours, but it was too late to turn back, he thought.

His wife abandoned the religion after several years of infertility and started visiting all sorts of places to aid her desire for a child; from mosques, to churches, to herbalists, she has been there.

Miraculously, she eventually conceived and gave birth to their only son, Qasim. Even after the acceptance of her prayer for a child, she insisted she would not continue her faith and should be left alone by her husband.

The chapter ends with Mr. Adekambi waking in the middle of the night with crippling regret on his mind about his choice of a wife.

### Chapter 3

Within the short period of time Qasim spent on the campus, he had already developed a reputation for his intellectual prowess. He was constantly hailed and respected by his course-mates and would usually give tutorial sessions to them.

On a Saturday afternoon, his mother decided to give him a surprise visit. This was where she introduce Gbenga, the son of a commissioner, to Qasim, and encouraged her son to have a close relation with him, as he was part of the school's "Elite".

Listening to the advice of his mother, Qasim was soon introduced to the "club" in which Gbenga was a part of, called Kengites Club. It was also known as the Palm Wine Drinker's club, which made Qasim reject Gbenga's initial offer. Sadly, after encouragement from Gbenga, Qasim agreed to attend one of the clubs events.

The event was meant to inaugurate a new head of the club and initiate new recruits into it. Qasim decided to also join the club with the thought that he could easily back out later if he was not comfortable with it. Little did he know it was the beginning of his downfall.

### Chapter 4

Qasim's closest friend, AbdurRazaq could hardly believe the report that his friend had been initiated into the Kegite's club. AbdurRazaq tried every method he could to convince his close friend to renounce his membership and continue with his normal life, but Qasim had already made up his mind and wouldn't listen to any of his friend's words.

After several weeks of roaming around with members of the club, Gbenga took the opportunity to introduce his new accomplice to his secret cult, the Red Ox. Qasim did not bat an eye and was initiated the same week.

Qasim witnessed his first violence fight when he was out with Gbenga for one of Red Ox's night parties. It was then that several members of a rival cult attacked them and a fight broke out. Gbenga took the opportunity to 'eliminate' one particular assailant he has wanted to get rid of for a long time. They left the scene with Qasim, now called Shina, impressed with Gbenga's combat skills.

### Chapter 5

By now, Qasim had been promoted to the Deputy Don III of Red Ox and his commitment to the cult was reflected on his G.P.A., which has now dropped significantly.

It was also the election session at the school, and several students were competing for the role of the president of the Student Union. Candidate Malcom X was running against the main opposition Fryo, who intended to host a beauty pageant on campus. It was obvious who the winner of the race would be right at the final campaign.

### Chapter 6

The election had several attempts of cultists’ attacks but due to the diligence of the security personnel on ground, none of it was successful.

By the afternoon, the vote had been tallied and the Dean of Students Affair announced the winner.

Malcom X won with a landslide.

Other organizations of the school soon had their elections too, including the MSSN. Qasim's once close friend, AbdurRazaq, was elected as the new Amir of the school.

### Chapter 7

The Student Union President had a crucial meeting with the heads of organizations, both religious and secular, on campus on how to move the school forward by eradicating cultism.

Several plans were finalized to help with their agenda; one was to organize seminars orientating students about the danger of cultism both from outside speakers and from ex-cultists. Posters and pamphlets were planed to be distributed around the campus.

The MSSN organized its annual "Jihad Week". The theme of the year was Emancipation from Bondage. Fortunately, Gbenga, who was a Muslim, attended the Friday sermon that very week and heard the captivating sermon. The speech started with pointing out the factors that lures people into cultism and how they are finally recruited, he then talked about the negative consequences of their action on both their personal lives and the society. The sermon torched Gbenga to the bone and he felt uneasy throughout the day. He couldn't hold back the feeling anymore and so he headed to the Amir's office to have a discussion with him.

After a long discussion with the Amir and his cabinet member, Gbenga decided to leave his ways and renounce his membership from the cult. By the following week, he had been attending the prayers regularly at the mosque.

All this while, Qasim now known as Shina, was on a 'critical' operation to eliminate a rival cult leader in another university. After successfully carrying out his operation, he was promoted to a national position in the cult's hierarchy. Upon his arrival, the first piece of news he heard what that of Gbenga. Shina just could swallow such a news and planned on seeing Gbenga himself.

Gbenga knew it would be an almost impossible task to convince Shina that he is on the wrong path, especially since he had recently been promoted to the top echelon of the cult, but he knew it was a task he needed to do anyway.

Unsurprisingly, Shina did not budge a little on his stance and instead insisted that this is what his life is meant to be.

### Chapter 8

Several months later, Gbenga, now Taofeeq, has changed for the better in his academics. He had been attending lectures, asking any student to explain any difficult subject to him and seeking assistance from lecturers.

AbdurRazaq, the Amir, heard a rumour that other cults have grouped together to eliminate Shina. He knew his friend is not the same person he used to be, but he still had a love for him. Therefore, he decided to visit him once again to hear what he has to say.

Shina dismissed his old friends concerns and told him there was nothing that could hurt him.

The Amir left without saying a word. He contacted his father and informed him of the latest development. Shina's father told him there was nothing he could do since his wife had succeeded in building a barrier between him and his son. He only asked the Amir to keep his son in his prayer.

### Chapter 9

It was the convocation day at BENSU and joyous families have packed the campus ground. Mrs. Adekambi, Shina's mother, was also present at the event thinking her son would be among the graduates. He knew his mother's assumption but did not bother to correct her; he wanted his mother to see the surprise herself.

After waiting for several hours in the hall and no sign of her son, she started to get desperate. She called his number serval times before his friend picked the phone up for him. She yelled aggressively that she wanted to see her son this instant.

On his way to the campus, a group of rival cultist ambushed Shina and his friends. A gunfight ensued. Unfortunately, Shina was severely outnumbered and was shot. The assailants escaped with a minivan and left him gasping in his pool of blood. The news immediately spread to the guests including his mother.

Upon hearing this, she and her driver rushed to the scene. He was placed on a Life Support Machine for six days straight. Mrs. Adekambi started wailing seeing her only child dying. Sitting on the bare floor, Mr. Adekambi was just looking, staring at the empty world before him. He did not know what to do anymore.

By the following morning, Shina finally gave up the ghost.
