IRREPARABLE LOSS

Abdussalam Sulayman

---
This is a captivating story of redemtion, adversity, regret and so much more. The writer did an amazing work in being able to jampack so much emotional attachment, character development and life lessons into such a few number of pages. 

Each major character in the story went through a form of character developemt one way or another throughout the story. From the main protagonist, Qasim, to then main antagonist Gbengene, to their parents. 

As someone descends into debauchery and degeneracy one is brought out into light and guidance.

### Chapter 1
The story opened with a gunshot which rang out at the matriculation ceremony of BENSU, followed by six young men searching through the premise for a person in particular. All the atendees of the event were understandably shocked by the event, yet the Student Union decided to proceed with the ceremony. 

The school's head of Muslim Students Society then took to the stage to concuil the parents and inform them that such occurance is uncommon on the campus and it only affected the cult memberof of the school. The Amir then adviced the students to be an active member of the MSSN instead of other clubs who claim to be "Cool". 

The gather was dispersed that the evening when the parameter of the campus was confirmed to safe. 

### Chapter 2
Qasim's parents have a disagreement over the hostel their son should reside in while at the university. Mr Adekambi wanted his soo to be in the Muslim Arcade which is occupied by alot of the school's muslim students while Mrs Adekambi wanted him to reside in California, a hostel that is know to be for the student elites. 
Mr Adekambi eventually reluctantly relented and accepted that Qasim could stay in California, since his son schooled abroad, he might not be used to the non-luxirious  Muslim Arcade. 

Mr Adekambi pulled his son to the side to have a personal one on one talk with him after dinner. While giving him valuable advice Mrs Adekambi rudely interupted their converstation on the basis that the advice is getting too much for her son, and Qasim is pulled away from his room. His wife's behaviour has been irritating him for a long time but this particular night it was just too painful to handle. 

Apparently, Mr Adekambi met his wife at the university and they happened to fall in love. Ignoring the advice of multiple seniors and elders he proposed to her and got married. It was after their marriage that he realised she is not the type he would like to help raise his children, but it was too late to turn back by then, he thought. 
His wife abandoned the religion after several years of infertility and started visiting all sorts of places to aid her desire for a child, from mosques to churches to herbalists, she has been there. 

Miraculously, she eventually conceved and gave birth to their only son, Qasim. Even after the acceptance of her prayer for a child, she insisted she wouldn't countinue her faith and should be left alone by her husband. 

The chapter ends with Mr Adekambi waking in the middle of the night with crippling regret on his mind about his choice of a wife. 


### Chapter 3 
Within the short period of time Qasim spent on the campus he had already developed a reputation for his intellectual prowese. He was constantly hailed and respected by his coursemates and would usually give tutorial sessions explaining topics. 

On Saturday afternoon, his mother decided to give him a surprise visit at his hostel. This was where she introduce Gbenga, the son of a commissionier, to Qasim, and encouraged her son to have a close relation with him as he was part of the school's 
"Elite".

Listening to the advice of his mother, Qasim was soon introduced to the "club" in which Gbenga was a part of, called Kengites Club. It was also know as the Palm Wine Drinker's club which made Qasim reject Gbenga's intial offer. Sadly, after encouragement from Gbenga, Qasim agreed to attend one of the clubs events. 

The event was meant to inaugurate a new head of the club and also initiate new comers into it. Qasim decided to also join the club with the thought that he could easily back out later if he wasn't conftable with it. Little did he know it was the beginning of his downfall.

### Chapter 4
Qasim's clossest friend, AbdurRazaq could hardly believe the report that his friend has been initiated inito the Kegite's club. AbdurRazaq tried every method he could to try to convince his close friend to renounce his membership and continue with his life, but Qasim has already made up his mind and wouldn't listen to any of his once friend's words.

After several weeks of roaming around with members of the club, Gbenga took the opportunity to introduce his new accomplice to his secert clut, the Red Ox. Qasim didnt bat an eye and was initiated the same week. 

Qasim witnessed his first violence fight when he was out with Gbenga for one of Red Ox's night parties. It was then that several members of a rival cult attacked them and a fight broke out. Gbenga took the opportunity to 'eliminate' on particular assailant he has wanted to get rid of for a long time. They left the scene with Qasim, now called Shina, impressed with Gbenga's combat skills. 

### Chapter 5
By now, Qasim has been prommoted to the Deputy Don III of Red Ox and his commitment to the cult was reflected on his G.P.A. which has now dropped significantly. 

Its was the election session at the school and several students were compiting for the role as the presient of the student union. After intense campaning it was obbody elected by Malcom X as their next president.
