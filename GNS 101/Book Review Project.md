IRREPARABLE LOSS

Abdussalam Sulayman

---
This is a captivating story of redemption, adversity, regret and so much more. The writer did an amazing work in being able to jampack so much emotional attachment, character development and life lessons into such a few number of pages. 

Each major character in the story went through a form of character development one way or another throughout the story. From the main protagonist, Qasim, to then main antagonist Gbenga, to their parents. 

As someone descends into debauchery and degeneracy one is brought out into light and guidance.

### Chapter 1
The story opened with a gunshot which rang out at the matriculation ceremony of BENSU, followed by six young men searching through the premise for a person in particular. All the attendees of the event were understandably shocked by the event, yet the Student Union decided to proceed with the ceremony. 

The school's head of Muslim Students Society then took to the stage to console the parents and inform them that such occurrences is uncommon on the campus and it only affected the cult member of of the school. The Amir then advised the students to be an active member of the MSSN instead of other clubs who claim to be "Cool". 

The gather was dispersed that the evening when the parameter of the campus was confirmed to be safe. 

### Chapter 2
Qasim's parents have a disagreement over the hostel their son should reside in while at the university. Mr. Adekambi wanted his soo to be in the Muslim Arcade which is occupied by a lot of the school's Muslim students while Mrs. Adekambi wanted him to reside in California, a hostel that is know to be for the student elites. 
Mr. Adekambi eventually reluctantly relented and accepted that Qasim could stay in California, since his son schooled abroad, he might not be used to the non-luxurious  Muslim Arcade. 

Mr. Adekambi pulled his son to the side to have a personal one on one talk with him after dinner. While giving him valuable advice Mrs. Adekambi rudely interrupted their conversation on the basis that the advice is getting too much for her son, and Qasim is pulled away from his room. His wife's behavior has been irritating him for a long time but this particular night it was just too painful to handle. 

Apparently, Mr. Adekambi met his wife at the university and they happened to fall in love. Ignoring the advice of multiple seniors and elders he proposed to her and got married. It was after their marriage that he realized she is not the type he would like to help raise his children, but it was too late to turn back by then, he thought. 
His wife abandoned the religion after several years of infertility and started visiting all sorts of places to aid her desire for a child, from mosques to churches to herbalists, she has been there. 

Miraculously, she eventually conceived and gave birth to their only son, Qasim. Even after the acceptance of her prayer for a child, she insisted she wouldn't continue her faith and should be left alone by her husband. 

The chapter ends with Mr. Adekambi waking in the middle of the night with crippling regret on his mind about his choice of a wife. 


### Chapter 3 
Within the short period of time Qasim spent on the campus he had already developed a reputation for his intellectual prowess. He was constantly hailed and respected by his course-mates and would usually give tutorial sessions explaining topics. 

On Saturday afternoon, his mother decided to give him a surprise visit at his hostel. This was where she introduce Gbenga, the son of a commissioner, to Qasim, and encouraged her son to have a close relation with him as he was part of the school's 
"Elite".

Listening to the advice of his mother, Qasim was soon introduced to the "club" in which Gbenga was a part of, called Kengites Club. It was also know as the Palm Wine Drinker's club which made Qasim reject Gbenga's initial offer. Sadly, after encouragement from Gbenga, Qasim agreed to attend one of the clubs events. 

The event was meant to inaugurate a new head of the club and also initiate new comers into it. Qasim decided to also join the club with the thought that he could easily back out later if he wasn't comfortable with it. Little did he know it was the beginning of his downfall.

### Chapter 4
Qasim's closest friend, AbdurRazaq could hardly believe the report that his friend has been initiated into the Kegite's club. AbdurRazaq tried every method he could to try to convince his close friend to renounce his membership and continue with his life, but Qasim has already made up his mind and wouldn't listen to any of his once friend's words.

After several weeks of roaming around with members of the club, Gbenga took the opportunity to introduce his new accomplice to his secret cult, the Red Ox. Qasim didn't bat an eye and was initiated the same week. 

Qasim witnessed his first violence fight when he was out with Gbenga for one of Red Ox's night parties. It was then that several members of a rival cult attacked them and a fight broke out. Gbenga took the opportunity to 'eliminate' on particular assailant he has wanted to get rid of for a long time. They left the scene with Qasim, now called Shina, impressed with Gbenga's combat skills. 

### Chapter 5
By now, Qasim has been promoted to the Deputy Don III of Red Ox and his commitment to the cult was reflected on his G.P.A. which has now dropped significantly. 

It was the election session at the school and several students were competing for the role as the president of the Student Union. Candidate Malcom X was running against the main opposition Fryo, who intended to host a beauty pageant on campus. It was obvious who the winner of the race would be right at the final campaign. 

### Chapter 6
The election had several attempts of cultists attacks but due to the diligence of the security personnel on ground none of it was successful. 

By the afternoon the vote has been tallied and the winner was announced. 
Malcom X won with a landslide. 

Other organizations of the school soon had their elections too, including the MSSN. Qasim's once close friend, AbdulRazaq, was elected as the new Amir of the school. 

### Chapter 7

The Student Union President had a crucial meeting with the heads of organizations, both religious and secular, on campus on how to move the school forward by eradicating cultism. 

Several plans were finalized to help with their agenda, one was to organize seminars orientating students about the danger of cultism both from outside speakers and ex-cultists. Posters and pamphlets were planed to be distributed around the campus. 

The MSSN organized its annual "Jihad Week". The theme of the year was Emancipation from Bondage. Fortunately, Gbenga, who was a Muslim, attended the Friday sermon that very week and heard the captivating sermon. The speech started with pointing out the factors that lures people into cultism and how they are finally recruited, he then talked about the negative consequences of their action on both their personal lives and the societal repercussions. The sermon torched Gbenga and he felt uneasy throughout the day. He couldn't hold back the feeling anymore and so he headed to the Amir's office to have a discussion with him. 

After a long discussion with the Amir and his cabinet member, Gbenga decided to leave his ways and renounce his membership from the cult. By the following week, he had been attending the prayers regularly at the mosque. 

All this while, Qasim now know as Shina, was on a 'critical' operation to eliminate a rival cult leader in another university. After successfully carrying out his operation he was promoted to a national position in the cult's hierarchy. Upon his arrival, the first piece of news he was given what that of Gbenga. Shina just could swallow such a thing and planned on seeing Gbenga himself. 

Gbenga knew it would be an almost impossible task to convince Shina that he is on the wrong path, especially since he has recently been promoted to the top of the cult, but he knew it was a task he needed to do anyway. 

Unsurprisingly, Shina didn't budge a little on his stance and instead insisted that this is what his life is meant to be. 

### Chapter 8

Several months later, Gbenga, now Taofeeq, has changed for the better in his academics. He had been attending lectures, asking any student to explain any difficult subject to him and seeking assistance from lecturers. 

AbdulRazaq, the Amir, heard a rumor that other cults have grouped together to eliminate Shina. He knew his friend isn't the same person he used to be, but he still had a love for him. So he decided to visit him once again to hear what he has to say. 

Shina dismissed his old friends concerns and told him there was nothing that could hurt him. 

The Amir left without saying a word. He contacted his father and informed him of the latest development. Shina's father told him there was nothing he could do since his wife had succeeded in building a barrier between him and his son. He only asked the Amir to keep his son in his prayer. 

### Chapter 9

It was the convocation day at BENSU and joyful families have packed the campus ground. Mrs. Adekambi, Shina's mother, was also present at the event thinking her son would be among the graduates. He knew his mother's assumption but didn't bother to correct her, he wanted his mother to see the surprise herself.

After waiting for several hours in the hall and no sign of her son, she started to get desperate. She called his number serval times before his friend picked the phone up for him. She yelled aggressively that she wanted to see her son this instant. 

On his was to the campus, Shina and his friends were ambushed by a group of rival cultist. A gunfight ensued. Unfortunately, Shina was severely outnumbered and was shot. The assailants escaped with a minivan and left him gasping in his pool of blood. The news immediately spread to the guests including his mother. 

Hearing this, she and her driver rushed to the scene. He was placed on a Life Support Machine for six days straight. Mrs. Adekambi started wailing seeing her only child dying. Sitting on the bare floor, Mr. Adekambi was just looking, staring at the empty world before him. He didn't know what to do anymore. 

By the following morning, Shina finally gave up the ghost.
