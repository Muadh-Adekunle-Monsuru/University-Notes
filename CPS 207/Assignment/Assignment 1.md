#### Differentiate between syntax and semantics in context of programming language

The **syntax** of a language is the grammatical rules that govern the ways in which words, symbols, expressions and statements may be formed and combined. 
The syntax of a programming language is the part of the language definition that says what programs look like; their form and structure.

The **semantics** of a language are the rules that govern its *meaning*, meaning is defined as what happens when the program is executed. The **semantics** of a programming language is the part of the language definition that says what programs do; their behavior and meaning.
