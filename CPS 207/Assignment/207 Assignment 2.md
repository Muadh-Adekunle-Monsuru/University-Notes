#### Differentiate between logical and syntax error

A logical error is a mistake that the programmer made while designing the solution to a problem, which results in an incorrect or wrong output.
Like using - instead of + sign in a calculation. 
x = 0
y = 3
z = y/x


A syntax error would be an error in the writing out of the program. 
Such as typing prnt("hello world") instead of print("hello world").

Diagnostic tools can identify when a syntax error is made but might not be able to know when a logical error has been made.
