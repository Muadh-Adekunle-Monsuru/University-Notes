1. Explain 3 categories of statement in Assembly Language
	1. ASSEMBLY DIRECTIVE: tell the assembler about the various aspects of the assembly process
	2. EXECUTABLE STATEMENT: tell the processor what to do. Each instruction consists of an operation code (opcode). Each executable instruction generates one machine language instruction
	3. MACROS: ACT AS TEXT SUBSTITUTION MECHANISM, THE CONSIST OF BOTH ASSEMBLY DIRECTIVES AND EXECUTABLE STATEMENTS****
2. Write down Assembly language instruction format and explain each part with appropriate examples
	**1. [LABEL]  [MNEMONIC]  [OPERAND]  [COMMENT]**
		1. **LABEL: IT IDENTIFIES A LINE OF CODE, SO IT CAN BE REFERED TO IN A MACRO**
		2. **MNEMONIC: ALSO CALLED OPECODE, IT IS THE ONLY COMPULSORY PART OF AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION, IT TELLS THE MACHINE WHAT OPERATION TO PERFORM WHETHER ADDITION, SUBTRACTION AND SO ON.** 
		3. **OPERAND: IT INFORMS THE COMPUTER WHERE TO GET THE DATA  IT WANTS TO MANIPULATE AND WHERE TO STORE THE FINAL DATA**
		4. **COMMENT: IT IS USED TO INFORM THE PROGRAMMER OR OTHER USERS WHAT THE PARTICULAR LINE OF CODE IS DOING, IT IS DENOTED BY A SEMICOLON ;**
3. Difference between machine language and assembly language
	Assembly language and machine code are both low-level programming languages Assembly language is a symbolic representation of machine code instructions. It uses mnemonics to represent the underlying machine code instructions, making it easier for humans to read and write. Machine code, on the other hand, is the actual binary code that is executed by the computer's processor. It is not easily readable by humans and is usually generated by an assembler program from assembly language source code. In summary, assembly language is a human-readable representation of machine code, while machine code is the actual code executed by the processor.
4. Explain how processor perform its functions or execute instructions
	The process through which the processor controls the execution of instructions is referred as the fetch-decode-execute cycle, or the execution cycle. It consists of three continuous steps:
	- Fetching the instruction from memory 
	- Decoding or identifying the instruction 
	- Executing the instruction
5. Explain briefly logic components of a single chip microprocessor
		1.  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, and logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT.
		2.  **Control Unit:** responsible for fetching instructions from memory and decoding them to execute the correct operation. It controls the flow of data within the microprocessor.
	3. **Register**: small, fast memory units that store data used by the ALU and control unit
	4.  **Bus**: a set of connections that allow the microprocessor to communicate with memory and other peripheral devices.
	5.  **Memory**: holds the instructions and data used by the microprocessor.
	6.  **Input/Output (I/O) ports:** allow the microprocessor to communicate with external devices such as keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
	7.  **Clock**: a timing signal that synchronizes the operation of the microprocessor.
6. Give 3 examples of 16bits, 32bits and 64bits registers
	1. **16 BIT: AX, BX, CX
	2. **32 BIT: EAX, EBX, ECX**
	3. **64 BIT; RAX, RBX, RCX****
7. Explain 3 modes of execution in an high level programming language
		In high-level programming languages, there are typically two modes of execution:

	1.  **Interpreter mode**: In this mode, the program is executed line by line, with each line of code being interpreted and executed as it is read. This mode is typically slower than the compiler mode, but it allows for more flexibility and easier debugging, as errors can be caught and corrected as the program is executed.
    
	2.  **Compiler mode:** In this mode, the program is first translated into machine code (or object code) by a compiler. This machine code can then be executed directly by the computer's processor. This mode is typically faster than interpreter mode, as the program is executed directly by the processor, but it can be less flexible and debugging can be more difficult, as errors may not be caught until the program is executed.
8. What is the difference between processor and microprocessor CHIP
	A microprocessor chip and a processor are related but different concepts. A microprocessor chip is a physical piece of silicon that contains the transistors and other components that make up a microprocessor. It is a chip that can be inserted into a motherboard or other device to provide processing capabilities.

	A processor, on the other hand, refers to the entire package of components that perform the processing functions. It includes the microprocessor chip, as well as other components such as cache memory, buses, and support circuits. A processor is the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, it is the "brain" that performs the instructions of a computer program.

	In summary, a microprocessor chip is a physical piece of silicon that contains the transistors and other components that make up a microprocessor, while the processor is the entire package of components that perform the processing functions, including the microprocessor chip, the memory, buses, and support circuits.
9. What are constants. Give 2 examples of integer, and character constants
		CHARACTERS IN OUR PROGRAM WHICH RETAINS ITS SAME VALUE THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. INTEGER:2, 3, CHARACTER A, B**
10. Write an assembly language program to find the sum of all numbers between 1 & 10 starting from the rear and divide by 5. Leave the answer in Ax
	```ASSEMBLY
	.model small
	.stack 100h
	.code
	 mov ax 10
	 mov bx, 0
	 
		myloop:
			add bx, ax
			dec ax
			cmp ax, 0
			jg myloop
	
	mov ax, bx
	div ax,  5

	end
```
```


1. What are the errors in the following and find the appropriate correction
	1. mov ax, 3d
	2. mov cx, ch:  cx is a register and ch is the high-order byte of the cx register. TO access the value of ch as a seperate entity, you need to use a different register such as dx. 
	3. mov eax, 1h
