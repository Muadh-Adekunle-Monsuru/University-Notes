### Control Structure
They are grouped into three:
- Sequential Structure
- Decision Structure
- Looping Structure

	- **Sequential Structure:** The sequence structure is a case where the steps in an algorithm are constructed in such a way that, no condition step is required. The sequence structure is the logical equivalent of a straight line.
	- **Decision structure**; The sequence structure is a case where the steps in an algorithm are constructed in such a way that, no condition step is required. The sequence structure is the logical equivalent of a straight line

	- **Iteration Structure**; program instruction that repeats some statement or sequence of statements a number of times is called an iteration or a loop. The commands used to create iterations or loops are all based on logical tests.
