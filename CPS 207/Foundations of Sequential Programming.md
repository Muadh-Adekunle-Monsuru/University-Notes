In summary foundations of sequential program introduce you to fundamental  concepts of computer programs and how the computer system process such program.   

Programming language involves using constructs such as **variables** and **constant**. Also called **Identifiers.**
For a course called Foundation of Sequential Program
##### Program Design and Specification
- **Reliability:** the program can be depended upon always to do what it is supposed to do
- **Maintainability**: The program will be easy to change or modify when the need arises
- **Readability**: The program will be easy for a programmer to read and understand
- **Performance:** The program causes the tasks to be done quickly and efficiently
- **Storage Saving:** The program is not allowed to be unnecessarily long to achieve memory efficiency. 

##### Program Development Life Cycle [PDLC]
Steps in the development of programs:
1. Problem Definition
2. Problem Analysis
3. Algorithm Development
4. Coding & Documentation
5. Testing & Debugging
6. Maintenance

## Sequential Program Structures:

Sequential Programming is when the algorithm to be solved consists of operations one after the other. 

#### Classification of Computer Based on Processor:

- **Parallel Computing:** Is relatively fast, the processors perform different tasks independently and simultaneously 

- **Sequential Computing**: are forms in which program components are constructed, organized and interrelated. 



An **identifier** is a **variable**, while a **literal** are characters that are *used literally*. Literals are differentiated from identifiers by putting them in **"quotation marks"**.

#### Data Declaration

#### Types of declaration:
- **Explicit**: users defined the variable and its data type.
- **Implicit:** The system defined the data type of a variable. 

#### Purpose of Declarations:
- **Storage Management**: It helps the computer make best use of memory, by allocating the optimum size of memory for the data
- **Choice of Storage Representation:** Helps translator determine the best storage representation

```java
system.out.println("HEllO WORLD!")
```
