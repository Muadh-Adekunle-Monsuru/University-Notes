10. Differentiate between the following terms:
	1. **Web and Internet:** The internet is the infrastructure .of interconnected networks and the web is the services that runs on to/p of it. The web allows user to access and share information, conduct transactions, and communicate with each other. 
	**2. Block level and Inline element**: Block element take up the full width of their parent container, create a new line before and after themselves. Inline element only take up as much width as necessary. Do not create a new line before or after themselves. Block level elements can contain inline elements but inline elements can only contain other inline elements. 
	**3. Relative hyperlinks and absolute hyperlinks:** A relative URL points to a resource on the same website, and is defined relative to the current page. An absolute URL points to a resource on any website and is defined with the complete URL. Relative URLs are more flexible and maintainable, because they do not depend on a specific domain or path. Means that if the website's domain or file structure changes, the links will still work as long as the relative paths stay the same. Absolute URLs are less flexible because if the domain or file structure changes, the links will not work anymore.
