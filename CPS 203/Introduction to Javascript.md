JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, meaning this script should be referenced within in the HTML 

Can be used to track user events on the site such as clicking buttons and so on. 
JavaScript is placed within a $<script>$ tag in the **head or body** or both or as external file

JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to **declare** variables.

Implementing JavaScript makes a site dynamic from static. 

JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to make a web page dynamic, it enables webpage to include programs that interact with the user, control the browser and ==dynamically== create HTML content. JavaScript is
- lightweight and mostly commonly used as a part of webpages whose implementations allow client side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
- It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
- It is network centric (net-centric) application works with networks
- It is complimentary to HTML, CSS, Java and others
- It is open-source and cross-platform (it can be used cross various platforms)

###  The three main languages of the web
- HTML: Define the content of the page
- CSS: Designs the layout/appearance of the page
- JavaScript: Allows for interactivity and behavior of the webpage



**Advantages of JavaScript**:
- Less server interaction: user input can be validated before sending the page to the server, which reduces the network traffic.
- Immediate feedback to the visitor, users do not need to wait for the reply from the server to see if their input is valid
- Increased interactivity: One can create interface that reacts when user hovers over them with a mouse
- Richer interfaces: One can use JavaScript to include items like drag and drop components and sliders to give a rich interface. 

**Disadvantages of JavaScript**
- It is not a full fledge programming language, therefore it lacks various important features:
	- It does not allow the reading or writing of files, for security reason
	- Cannot be used for networking applications from the server side because their is no such support available
	- Does not have any multi-threading

**Development Tools:**
