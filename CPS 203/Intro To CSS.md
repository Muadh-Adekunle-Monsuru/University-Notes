### Cascading Style Sheet
Used to beautify a page. To give it more *spice* 
contained within the "style" tag. Used to format they same types of tags at once. e.g change all heading in the page to blue. 


#### Rules of CSS:
- the selector
- the property 
- the value

```css
p{
font-family: monoscape;
}

3 types of selectors: HTML, Class, ID. 
p is an html selector

font-family is the property

monoscape is the value
```
