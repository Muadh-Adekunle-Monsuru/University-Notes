**1. History of Website**

While working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee became frustrated with the inefficiencies and difficulties posed by finding information stored on different computers. On 12 March 1989, he submitted a memorandum, titled "Information Management: A Proposal", to the management at CERN. The proposal used the term "web" and was based on "a large hypertext database with typed links". "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document, you could skip to them with a click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. Berners-Lee notes the possibility of multimedia documents that include graphics, speech and video, which he terms hypermedia. 

Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving The Web, he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of both technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible. But, when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself.

With help from Cailliau, he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "hypertext project" called World Wide Web (abbreviated "W3") as a "web" of "hypertext documents" to be viewed by "browsers" using a client–server architecture

By December 1990, Berners-Lee and his work team had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: HTTP, HTML, the first web browser  WorldWideWeb, the first web server, and the first web site (http://info.cern.ch) containing the first web pages that described the project itself was published on 20 December 1990

After 1993 the World Wide Web saw many advances to indexing and ease of access through search engines. As its popularity increased through ease of use, incentives for commercial investment in the Web also grew. By the middle of 1994, the Web was outcompeting the other browsing systems for the Internet.

**2. What is a web application?**

A web application is a client-server computer program that uses a web browser to perform a particular function.
Web applications can be designed for a wide variety of uses and can be used by anyone; from an organization to an individual for numerous reasons. Commonly used Web applications can include webmail, online calculators, or e-commerce shops.

**3. What are the components of web applications?**

There are usually 3 tiers structure in a web application. 
	1. Presentation: A web browser serves the function of the first tier
	2. Application: An engine using dynamic web content technology is the middle tier
	3. Storage: Database and storage 

**4. Differentiate between Desktop applications and Web applications:**

-   Web applications can be used on any platform: Windows, Linux, Mac… as they all support modern browsers. Unlike desktop application which needs to be build for each operating system
-   Can be updated frequently there is no need to remind users to update their applications.
-   You can either make use of the computer or your mobile device to access the application unlike desktop applications.
-   Web applications are a cost-effective option for any organization as the don't need multiple developer teams.
- Most web applications can not be access when there is no internet connection, unlike desktop applications that works without internet.
